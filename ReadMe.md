I created an application to see if an LLM can censor based on a prompt. Read the meduim article for more information.

There are two versions of the applications , one is a  notebook(Bleep notebook.ipynb) and the other is a streamlit application(app.py).

See example/ for an example. In this example the LLM censored food related words/phrases in the audio.
