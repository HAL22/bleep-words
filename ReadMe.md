I created an application to see if an LLM can censor based on a prompt. Read the Medium article for more information.

There are two versions of the applications, one is a  notebook(<b>Bleep notebook.ipynb</b>) and the other is a Streamlit application(<b>app.py</b>).

To see an example look at the <b>example directory</b>. In this example, an LLM censored food-related words/phrases from the original.wav audio resulting in the bleep.wav audio
